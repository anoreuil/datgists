#Syria

*Note:* This documentation (and the product) has changed dramatically since we started utilizing the AOC data produced by our implementing partner. Original documentation `Syria_Areas of Control Map_Geoprocessing Technical Steps` available on Q: `Q:\GIU_Documents\OTI\Guidance for OTI GIS Analysts - Map Procedures\Syria`

This is technical guidance on producing shapefiles depicting areas of influence in Syria. There are a few steps necessary to prepare the data for sharing including aggregation and appending of metadata


##Clean Data

- Receive data from partner, load in GIS
- Data comes converted from KML format so delete all the unecessary fields Except "snippet" which contains control data using the **table manager** tool or equivilent in ArcGIS.
- Rename `snippet` column to `Control` 
- Save data and close out of QGIS
- Bring into ArcGIS and run the `Repair Geometry` tool to get rid of self intersections.
- Run the `Dissolve:Data Management` tool to dissolve features by Control Type.

##Apply MetaData
- Delete the metadata file created by default by ArcGIS (it should be the one with the .xml file extension.
- Exit out of ArcGIS and Navigate to the AOC dataset in ArcCatalog. 
- View description tab and click Import (ensure you are importing from ArcGIS standard), navigating to the latest AOC data that has "Share" in the file name to select its metadata, import. 
- A few things will have to be edited in the metadata to bring it up to date. Mainly the dates. 
  - In Metadata:Details Change the Date Stamp to the Current Date 
  - In Resource:Distribution Change Distributor > Available Dates to Current Date 
  - In Resource:Fields Change Control/Beginning and Ending Date of Values to reflect the datas shelf life. 
- Save
