#LAC Region Program/Briefing Book Map Procedures#

*This guide notes any country-specific deviations from standard program map procedures.*

**Colombia Program**
* We create two versions--with and without target municipalities.
* Do not use db locations for activities; ask the PM for an updated activity list, then dissolve by location and funding. 
* Add updated target (beneficiary) municipalities from the OTI Data folder (can also be copied from Target Municipalities map).

**Honduras Program**
* Ask which map they want to use. Most recently, we used the "Process Briefing" map, updated in 11/2015. 
* Add program data from the db.
