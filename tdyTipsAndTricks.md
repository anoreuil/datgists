# TDY Tips & Tricks

Quick tips /
At your finger tips /
For a successful TDY /
So you don't cry /

## Before you Leave
- Get a Statement of Work (SOW).  This details what is expected of you in your time out there as an STTA (Short Term Technical Advisor)  Consult previous SOWs and make sure the OTI Field corner signs off on it.  Don't be affraid to ask for changes to it!
- Send the SOW to Andrew Hall so he can comment and forward the final to Justin as an FYI.  
- Talk to your DAT coworkers, especially if you are giving trainings.  They don't have cooties and might know a helpful thing or two and/or have contacts there.
- Meet with Amy to chat about past, current and future ICT/media support for the program.  
- Bring data!  You never know when you are going to need to make a map.  Email yourself a copy of the admin boundaires and surrounding countries...just in case!
- Give the Graphics team plenty of time to make any prodcuts you need.
- Organize as many meetings as you can before you head out (at a minimum a kickoff meeting).  Think if it makes sense to have them be in groups or one on one.
- Ask if the OTI or IP Field corners want maps printed off the plotter...people like big printed maps in their office. 

## While You are Out there
- Take good notes!  This will help when writing your Trip Report. 
- Hang out with the local staff.  Its almost hackneyed how much people say it, but its true...they are the best!
- Try to meet with local partners, if possible: listen to their needs, thank them for their time and discuss with SMT before sharing relevant resources (e.g. trainings)
- Bring back a goodie for your coworkers in DC...especially for Rory!
- Buy a mini flag...we are trying to collect flags of all the countries we visit on TDYs.
- Snap a stunning pic to share in our Weekly Update as a Fun Fact.  

## Back in the USA
- Write a trip report
  - Priotize writing it ASAP once you are back...or on the plane on the way back so you don't forget stuff.
  - Share it with the DC OTI corner before sharing it with the wider office...they may be aware of sensitivities that you are not.
- Use your trip report to write a blog post on the Technology Innovation Knowledge Network.
- Share what you learned with the broader ABC team and Office.
