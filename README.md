# DAT Gist Repo

##Intro
Gists are awesome! They help unlock all the knowledge you have and share it with your colleagues.  Going on a TDY and need someone to cover a project for you? Refer them to a gist!  Got food poisioning form Auntie B's tuna-casserole and won't be in the office for a while? Refer a member to a gist so your team-mates can continue making the beautiful maps without missing a beat.

A gist should be a focused document on one of two subjects explaining how to:
  - Create a sepcific product ( e.g. How to make the Monthly Program Map for Country XXX)
  - A specific task or processes  (How to do the *DAT Monthly Update* or how to use gdal to convert a csv to a shapefile) 

Please review the *Quick Start/Best Practicies Gist* before contributing to the team's Gist repo and when you add a new one, update the gist index.

##Disclosure
Since these are public gists please make sure to scrape all:
- PII
- Filepaths to datasets
- Specific program names
- Any other sensitive information or materials
