# The Basic Git Workflow for adding Gists

## Intro
This gist explains how to add a gist to the `datgists` repo using github-shell or your computer's command line.  Note that it is a super basic overview and git has a lot more functionality then what is described here.
Further, this gist assumes you have setup git or github-desktop, linked your profile, and understand some of the basic git jargon.

## Steps
1. 
*a.  If you are using git-shell open github-desktop to load the tools for github-shell.
*b.  Once git-desktop is open and all the tools are loaded open git-shell.
2. You have already *cloned* the repo skip to step _____ otherwise, go on to step 3.
3. find the link to the *datgist* repo
4. In github-shell navigate to the location on your desktop where you want the repository to be located by typing in" `cd path/to/location/on/desktop`  if you have created a folder already, you can type `cd` and drag the folder from the address bar into github-shell.
3. Navigate to the repo by entering `cd path/to/your/git/repo`
